## Notable Mods
### [Bountiful](https://modrinth.com/mod/bountiful)
<details>
  <h4>Mechanics</h4>
  Bounty boards can be found throughout the world in villages, and they'll generate bounties inside of them. These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!

  <h4>Decrees</h4>
  There exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!
  You can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when
  <h4>Bounty Tiers</h4>
  Just like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic (with a Legendary tier added on..)

  <h4>Reputation</h4>
  All bounty boards have their own value associated with them called "Reputation". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.
